# ROC Curve and AUC Analysis on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset

## Project Overview

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to train several binary classifiers on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset and evaluate their discrimination performance using:

- Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves  
- Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)  
- Optimal decision threshold selection  

The notebook fits **Logistic Regression**, **K-Nearest Neighbors**, **Support Vector Machine**, and **Random Forest** models, and visualizes their ROC curves using Plotly.
